By default, the code attempts to connect to the backend

to disable/enable this, go to:

-> ListingsComponent
    - on 'val picture:', switch String to Int (String = backend, Int = local)

-> com.example.sprint0backend.Listings.kt
    - Switch picture mode for backend/local

-> ListingsScreen
    - comment out the hardcoded listings
    - comment out appropriate lines in the ListingsScreen function
